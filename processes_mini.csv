a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg,okay auf den ersten blick wirkt das binion cafe ähm etwas es auch kein café sondern eher ein typisch amerikanisches lokal es ist mitten im casino untergebracht und wird nur mit dünnen wänden abgetrennt immerhin gibt es fenster hinaus casino wenn man das lokal betritt wird der erste eindruck nicht besser es sieht alles etwas verlebt aus da wir aber comps hatten und das essen somit fast gratis war haben wir uns trotzdem burger fritten bestellt die bedienung ist typisch amerikanisch aber nicht typisch las vegas nett aber nicht aufdringlich das essen kam nach einer zeitspanne die vermuten läßt dass es frisch zubereitet wurde das hat mich ehrlich gesagt etwas überrascht da ich wirklich geringe erwartungen diesen laden hatte noch mehr überrascht hat mich allerdings das essen die burger waren wirklich gut vor allem wenn man den preis bedenkt und die fritten sehr knusprig mit einer art panade wie burger king sie vor einigen jahren mal hatte die burger werden hier nicht fertig zusammengebaut einige zutaten salat zwiebeln tomaten gurken liegen daneben auf dem teller kann man sich seinen burger ganz nach dem eigenen geschmack zusammenstellen zum burger gehört entweder kartoffelsalat schmeckt tatsächlich ziemlich deutsch oder coleslaw gute qualität die fritten müssen extra bestellt werden ca extra die getränkepreise sind las vegas generell etwas höher hier sind sie für las vegas verhältnisse etwas günstiger softdrink bier comps werden hier grundsätzlich anstandslos akzeptiert trotzdem empfiehlt es sich die rechnung genau zu prüfen comps gutscheine bekommt man auf verschiedene arten als über den american casion guide oder direkt als flyer die hand gedrückt um diese dann zu nutzen muss man kostenlos mitglied im players club werden falls man eh im spielen lohnt sich das doppelt denn man kann dort täglich seine clubkarte swipen und comps abräumen freeplay slots oder tischspiele oder fürs oder täglich wechselnde geschenke auf dem flyer finden sich noch weitere gutscheine für ein mit einer million dollar gratis spiel mit der sehr geringen chance ein paar tausend dollar zu gewinnen einen las und drinks als bekommt man comps regelmäßig übers swipen seiner clubkarte ich würde hier immer wieder essen und sogar den vollen preis bezahlen wenn es nicht viele comps geben würde den einen stern abzug gibt es weil es beim ersten mal echt überwindung kostet den laden zu betreten und dort etwas zum essen zu bestellen,4
5iHctUjkQTGwEvOaBkwMRQ,wir hatten gutscheine von und das war der hauptgrund für den besuch die gutscheine wurden ohne probleme angenommen und entsprechend angerechnet der laden ist sehr klein deutschland würde man etwas wohl als mit bezeichnen innen gibt es nur sehr wenig sitzplätze außen gibt es etwas mehr sitzgelegenheiten aber auch reichlich bettelnde tauben wir hatten uns sandwiches bestellt diese wurden frisch zubereitet und waren großzügig belegt geschmacklich waren die sandwiches okay wir hatten außerdem noch eine portion fritten dazu bestellt diese sind aber eher nicht empfehlen etwas matschig der dazu bestellte kaffee einmal normal einmal latte war sehr zu empfehlen die tische waren nur eine regelmäßige reinigung der freien tische haben wir nicht miterlebt das publikum besteht hauptsächlich aus bürokräften die der nachbarschaft arbeiten das espression cafe ist sehr nah der fremont street man geht praktisch auf höhe des binions zum golden nugget und dann noch etwas weiter geradeaus wichtig der laden hat nur tagsüber geöffnet tipp man bekommt immer sehr günstig gutscheine über,3
Zzl4ffV9kFY3yOSSgyRUBQ,ich kann nur das casino bewerten da ich das hotel nicht genutzt habe eingang bekommt man üblicherweise einen couponflyer zugesteckt diesen sollte man bei seinem erstbesuch unbedingt mitnehmen der flyer enthält gutscheine für ein mit einer million dollar für ein gratis spiel mit der sehr geringer chance ein paar tausend dollar zu gewinnen für einen las und für ein hat man auf jeden fall schon mal gratis souvenirs kofferanhänger foto es lohnt sich dem playersclub vom binions beizutreten denn man kann dort täglich seine clubkarte swipen und comps abräumen freeplay slots oder tischspiele oder fürs oder täglich wechselnde geschenke das ist bunt gemischt von einfachen alten geräten bis zu den neuesten mit vielen features ausgestatteten geräten die bedienung mit getränken geht flott auch wenn man eher rand des casinos sitzt für die toilette muss man einmal quer durchs casino sie ist immer sauber und gepflegt gewesen die leute vom playersclub sind sehr nett wenn man mal einen coupon für ein geswipt hat kann man normalerweise zwischen den verfügbaren geschenken wählen wenn man geswipt hat bekommt man das ausgezahlt und kann das freeplay dann auch setzen und nicht unbedingt alles auf einmal das binions gehört auf jeden fall zum downtown,4
eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,wir waren im mai hier essen wir hatten einen two brunch entrees two well drinks two people für gekauft der laden ist etwas klein und akustisch eine katastrophe es ist sehr laut wir waren vormittags dort obwohl gar nicht viel platz für viele leute ist das ist aber auch schon der einzige kritikpunkt wir hatten x den perch burger bier und wir waren sehr zufrieden der burger war sehr gut die pommes hingegen waren nicht wirklich toll eher weich und kein genuss uns ging es eh nur um den burger und der war top und genug zum satt werden die bedienung war sehr freundlich und hat sich regelmäßig versichert dass wir alles haben wir brauchen das essen war den preis auf jeden fall wert und das bier war ja auch schon inklusive blieb für uns vor ort dann nur noch das trinkgeld der wurde ohne diskussion angenommen und verrechnet mit würden wir wiederkommen ohne eher nicht weil es uns zu laut war,4
-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,der beer park befindet sich direkt paris hotel casino über dem hexx man nimmt entweder außen die treppe nach oben oder innen den aufzug wir waren frühen mittag direkt zur öffnung dort die bedienung und auch das personal empfang hatte es wohl gar nicht eilig wir mussten nämlich ziemlich warten es lief zwar viel personal herum um die tische mit soßenträgern einzudecken aber wir wurden zunächst ignoriert obwohl noch gar keine anderen gäste da waren wir bekamen dann einen tisch zugewiesen und nach einer weile kam dann tatsächlich auch eine bedienung unseren tisch von da gab es personaltechnisch nichts mehr zu meckern denn unsere bedienung war sehr nett und aufmerksam wir hatten einen burger einen caesars salat und ein mit brisket anfangs saßen wir noch im schatten später wanderte dieser dass wir halb der sonne saßen tipp bei heißen sonnenwetter möglichst nah gebäude und nicht zur straße hin sitzen zur kühlung wurde dann die wasserdampfanlage angemacht ich persönlich hasse diese dinger die es leider inzwischen fast jeder ecke strip gibt aber das ist wohl geschmackssache zum glück haben wir davon unserem tisch nur wenig abbekommen wie man sich schon beim namen denken kann ist die hauptspezialität vom beer park bier auch wenn der ganze laden mit budweiser gebrandet ist bekommt hier biersorten aus aller welt auch aus deutschland tipp der theke kann man kostenlos einzelne biersorten probieren einfach nachfragen wir haben jedenfalls eine neue leckere biersorte gefunden zufälligerweise sogar aus las vegas das essen kam im normalen zeitrahmen wichtig ist wie schon erwähnt sind biere die hauptspezialität den speisen kommt hier nur eine nebenrolle zu sie werden serviert dass man sie tisch mit allen teilen kann und es gibt wohl nur plastikgeschirr der burger war saftig und mittelmäßig lecker völlig okay aber nichts besonderes für den preis auf jeden fall zu teuer der caesars salat war lecker allerdings mit zu wenig dressing ebenfalls zu teuer für den preis das war lecker und wirklich reichlich der preis war angemessen das bier sehr lecker unverschämt teuer ein glas für der ausblick auf den strip geht auf die gegenüberliegenen hotels die fontänen vom bellagio kann man nur sehen wenn man sich ganz aussen die geländertische setzt dann sitzt man tagsüber allerdings der prallen sonne man kann hier viele spiele spielen die überall verteilt sind tischkicker jenga außerdem wie üblich den meisten gibt es einige fernseher meist mit sportsendungen wir hatten hier einen bezahlt für speisen getränken es gab keine probleme bei der einlösung nun zur rechnung es gibt las vegas eine handvoll läden die nehmen unverschämterweise eine concession fee höhe von es wird zwar auf der karte darauf hingewiesen aber ziemlich klein einer ecke okay wir wussten das vorher und hatten ja außerdem eine gute ersparnis durch den trotzdem empfinden wir diese concession fee als unverschämt vor allem da die preise hier eh schon gesalzen sind fazit wir würden hier nicht mehr hingehen wir fanden das essen als zu teuer und nur zum biertrinken ist es erst recht viel zu teuer,2
